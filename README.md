Luisita is an scriptable graphics environment Ã  la Processing, only it's based on Lua & C++. 

It enables you to program graphic real-time applications (demos) without digging too deep into OpenGL or fighting with C++'s memory management. Its basic premise is to provide an easy to understand environment for newbies so they can begin with some scripting and maybe jump to c/c++ later, but it can be used by experts alike. The only limit is your imagination :-)

Demos written with Luisita consist in a demo script which uses the provided set of simple functions for handling graphics and music. This set is intentionally reduced and minimalist.

It uses Lua for scripting, Bass for playing sound, OpenGL for displaying graphics and Simple OpenGL Image Library for loading images.

Work in progress ;)
